Report a document.

To code this, we will add a property in the database for the object "file" that would be "reported". It would be a boolean that is true if the document has been reported. 
We will add a button in the page of each file that will allow users to report the document.
By clicking on it, it will set the "reported" property in the database as true and send a message to the owner.
The user who report will be able to specify which part of the document has a problem.
If the "reported" property is true, there will be a message or a picture in the file page to indicate to every user that this document might contain a mistake.
The owner will be able to see who reported the document, and what part of it.
When he thinks that the problem is fixed, he will click on a button (that only him will be able to see on the page) that will set the "reported" property to false.
