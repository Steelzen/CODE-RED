When a user logs into his or her account, a button labeled "Add/Update Signature" will appear in the "my profile"/ "my account" page. When you click the button, you'll be sent to a new page where you may add your digital signature. There are two possibilities for adding a signature:
• uploading a png image file 
• typing first and last names in a textbox with formatting choices
Either of the two alternatives is available to the user.
