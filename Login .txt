All the information gather from the form (only a login and a password) will be pass with the method POST

After that, in the back end, a function will checked if the login and password correspond to one user of the User database
If yes, it will redirect to the site with a session variable active with all the information of the curret user of the site

If not, i will redirect to the login page with a message that the user enter wrong information

We will also made a, forgot password feature, the user will have to enter a email link to his count to receive a mail with a new password that he will need to change.

FirstName : varchar
LasteName : varchar
